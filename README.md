____

 ## Project Idea
 [Build Knowledgebase Application on CHAOSS Website](https://github.com/chaoss/website/issues/708).

## Microtasks

### [Microtask - 1](microtask-1.md)

> Research knowledgebase plugins for WordPress (current version and updates)

### [Microtask - 2](microtask-2.md)

> Create a WordPress site. The site doesn't need to have real content but it should include dummy content (lorem ipsum...), navigation elements, and styling that complements the chaoss website.

### [Microtask - 3](microtask-3.md)

> Implement two knowledgebase plugins (free versions) on your WordPress site. If you are recommending a plugin that costs money, please reach out to a mentor to discuss.

### [Microtask - 4](microtask-4.md)

> Create a report to present the results of your micro-tasks and your proposal for implementing a knowledgebase on the CHAOSS website. Document the plugins and describe your design choices. Include links to your example implementations on your WordPress site.
