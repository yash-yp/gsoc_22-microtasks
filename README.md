## Additional Project Work
 
In addition to the completing the above microtasks, I have also created some automation systems that can help generate a metrics report for the metrics defined under a particular working group.

- [Automation : Tree Structure of LaTeX files](Automate-LaTeX-Tree)
    - This automation system creates a tree-like structure for the working group repository where the metric files are defined at the bottom level of the tree.
    - All the LaTeX files in the tree get converted to PDF, all at once by including them in the files of upper level which inturn are included in the master file.

- [Automation : Merge Markdowns](Automate-LaTeX-Tree)
    - This system combines the required metric markdowns to create a single merged markdown file.
    - The markdown files thus obtained contains all the required metrics. It is then converted and processed to generate the report. -->
