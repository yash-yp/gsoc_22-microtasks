# Microtask - 2

> ## Create a WordPress site. The site doesn't need to have real content but it should include dummy content (lorem ipsum...), navigation elements, and styling that complements the chaoss website.

## Site Link: http://chaossclone.ga/

The site is hosted on a free domain and is made using Wordpress. The site uses [`Astra`](https://wpastra.com/) as the base theme. Further customization has been done by using the font and colors from the website: https://chaoss.community/
